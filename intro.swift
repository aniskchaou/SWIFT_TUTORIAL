var myString = "Hello, World!"
print(myString)


//Comments
//Multi-line comments start with /* and terminate with the characters */

//Single-line comments are written using // at the beginning of the comment.



//Semicolons
//Swift 4 does not require you to type a semicolon (;) after each statement in your code, though it’s optional; and if you use a semicolon, then the compiler does not complain about it.

//However, if you are using multiple statements in the same line, then it is required to use a semicolon as a delimiter, otherwise the compiler will raise a syntax error. You can write the above Hello, World! program as follows −

var myString = "Hello, World!"; print(myString)


//Whitespaces
//A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a Swift 4 compiler totally ignores it.


var age
//There must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between var and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. 

int fruit = apples + oranges   //get the total fruits
//No whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some for better readability.

//Space on both side of a operator should be equal, for eg.

int fruit = apples +oranges    //is a wrong statement
int fruit = apples + oranges   //is a Correct statement
