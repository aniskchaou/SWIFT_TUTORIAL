## Comments

Multi-line comments start with /* and terminate with the characters */

Single-line comments are written using // at the beginning of the comment.



## Semicolons

Swift 4 does not require you to type a semicolon (;) after each statement in your code, though it’s optional; and if you use a semicolon, then the compiler does not complain about it.

However, if you are using multiple statements in the same line, then it is required to use a semicolon as a delimiter, otherwise the compiler will raise a syntax error. You can write the above Hello, World! program as follows −

    var myString = "Hello, World!"; print(myString)
